## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Mobile Developer** focused on building high-quality applications for the health, finance, and environmental sectors. I create scalable and maintainable codebases by applying **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM**, and **SOLID principles** from the ground up.

I've led the development of native iOS applications using **SwiftUI** and integrated systems like **HealthKit**, **Apple Watch**, and **biometric authentication** (Face ID, Touch ID). I’ve also built cross-platform apps with **React Native**, implementing features such as onboarding, real-time chat, AI voice assistants, and secure payment systems with **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay**.

My workflow incorporates **test-driven development**, **accessibility standards**, and **CI/CD automation** using **Fastlane** and **GitLab**, ensuring quality and consistency at every stage of delivery.
